                        Boots first? Nope. There's maybe a dozen heroes who might want to go Boots first. That includes: 1on1 matchups against Razor (to outrun the Static Link),
                        Roaming supports (like Sand King) when you have another Support who can buy Wards, Courier etc and in some cases Solo Offlaners against a strong Safe Lane.<br>
                        Some heroes have big starting disadvantages which should be counteracted as fast as possible. A Ring of Protection for Doom, a Gauntlet for Crystal Maiden or Shadow Shaman.<br>

                    <indent>
                        You want to stay in lane as much as possible, so Regen is a very big deal. Sometimes you might get away being greedy with just one pack of Tangos or one Salve.
                        If in doubt, get more Regen.<br>

                    <indent>
                        As Solos you are more likely to get a Bottle, so if your (expected) Laning matchup is not too heavily favoured to your enemy you can get away with just a single pack of Tangos or a Salve until you get your Bottle.

                    <indent>
                        Do you have a good amount of Health? Get Armor. 2000 HP + 15 Armor is way better than 3000 HP + 1 Armor.<br>
                        Generally, HP early to mid, Armor mid to late.

                    <indent>
                        Again, if you have good Health, get Magic Resistance (Cloak, Hood, Pipe).<br>
                        As a Carry/Solo and some Supports a BKB can be a good choice, too.
                        Usually though you will try to get basic HP items as a support to make you less vulnerable to the Magic Damage.
                        Opposite to Physical Damage, Magical Damage does not increase a lot more after the 20-30 minute mark.

                    Pretty much always carry a TP. As support, try to pick one up before you buy boots. Early game rotations can win lanes if you get a double kill on the diving enemy lane.<br>
                    If you are close to a significant item, like a Blink Dagger or BKB, take the time to actually get it and notify your allies of your intentions.
                <br><br>As a support or someone who doesn't get a lot of farm, keep it a Stick. The money used on the rest of the items for Magic Wand can be used on more important things.
                <br>Make sure you get a Flying Courier as fast as possible, especially if someone on your team is Bottle-crowing.

                If your carry just respawned, buy them a TP scroll if they are close to an item.

                <p> Do you have wards? You should. If you don't, then you need to think about why that is? Don't make it obvious where you place wards, try to make it look as if you're warding places you aren't actually warding.
                <br>Do you know of any confirmed enemy ward locations? If you do, consider dewarding them. This is especially important if they have your ancients warded and you have a carry who loves farming ancients (like Luna, for instance).
                <br>However, don't commit into a ward-fight with the enemy, just place your wards somewhere else and remember any warded places.

                    If you don't need to save for buyback, buy items before you die. It's convenient to have them queued up already.<br>
                    When respawning, consider if you really need to TP to lane. Especially as a support having the TP off cooldown is usually a better choice. Solos might want to TP to lane to not fall behind in XP.<br>

                        A Ring of Basilius (500 Gold) will give you a lot more Mana regen than basically any other item. You have roughly 0.5-1 Mana/second at the early levels.
                        A Ring of Basilius will double that mana regen. A Void Stone (+50%) will give you 0.3-0.5 for 875 Gold. Furthermore, Basilius will give you other things like Armor, too.<br>

                <p>Make sure your carry can stay alone in their lane and farm decently before you leave. If necessary babysit them until the lane gets easier. Make sure you only pull if your carry is in no danger of getting dived.</p>

                <p>
                    Make sure you either pull through into a big/medium camp or stack the small camp first. Only pull when the lane pushes, harass the enemy when the lane equilibrium is good. Take care when using AoE abilities as you might push the lane.<br>
                    Sometimes it's more useful for your team to zone out the enemy (offlaner usually) than get a bit more XP via stacking and pulling. Especially if the enemy has an early game lineup. That way your carry's last hits don't get contended either.

                    <strong>As a Support you have the ability to win 3 of your 3 lanes.</strong> You are not "bot" or "top". Supports are too meta for lanes.<br>
                    <u>Roaming</u><br>
                    <indent>
                        If you know your Carry can hold his own and the enemy Laner will not get too much for you to handle later, go roaming.
                        Assess which of the enemy lanes is the most vulnerable, which of your lanes it will be worth winning more and think about the offensive potential your Laners have.
                        A Lone Druid pre Level 5 will not be of much use as he can't deal fast damage or disable. However a Zeus might just need those 2 seconds of disable to get the necessary spells in for a kill.<br>
                        Consider the risk of the gank failing (possibly even with the enemy getting one or more kills). If the risk is decently high check if your Laner is winning the lane via Last Hits and Denies. If he is, don't gank that lane. Otherwise it might be necessary to take that risk.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Staying in one Lane will put pressure on that one enemy lane, roaming will put pressure on every enemy lane.<br>
                        Rule of Thumb: Hate on mid, really hard.

                    <u>Laying the Fundament</u><br>
                    <indent>
                        For your Roaming and Ganking to be successful, you need information. And Wards are the easiest way to get that information.
                        In the Laning phase farmers will usually stay in their lane, so finding them is easy. Focus your wards on Rune Spots and places where enemy Ganks could come from. This will also show you where approximately the enemy supports are.<br>
                        <br>
                        From the Mid-game onwards, focus more on the Jungle, often used paths like the Dire Secret Shop, the Radiant stairs South of the Mid-lane and objectives, like Roshan.<br>
                        If you can't find good opportunities for ganks, place the next set of Wards somewhere else.
                        <br><br>
                        The enemy might be doing the same laying of foundations. Smokes, Sentries and Gem are your friends.

                        When the enemy QoP starts auto-attacking (Puck), consider your current situation (health, (mana for) spells, positioning) and get a trade.
                        Usually it will just be comparable amounts of damage. But you might be able to phase-shift a Scream of Pain or Sonic Wave, causing the QoP to overextend (because she assumed it would hit) and get a kill.<br>

                        Especially in the early stages - is a very calculated thing. 10 HP too much and you don't get it, 10 HP less and the Siege Creep takes it right before you.
                        There are several ways to throw that off-balance. <strong>Toggle your Ring of Basilius or Ring of Aquila</strong> on and off to change the amount of armor of your creeps. <strong>Draw Creep-Aggro to prevent the enemy creeps from hitting your creeps.</strong>

                        Generally, percentage-based skills (Zeus' Passive, Vengeful Spirit's Aura) are better late-game (or weaker early-game, depending on the perspective).
                        A "Value point" in these abilites often suffices until later, when other abilities fall off.<br>

                    <indent>
                        Many Heroes have multiple (generally accepted) Skill builds (like Tinker or Nightstalker). You may want to wait to skill and keep the skill points.
                        When the occasion arises you can skill the required skill and capitalize. For example as Level 3 Nightstalker before the first nightfall, only put points into
                        Void. While you want to have Hunter In The Night come nightfall you may be able to get a kill with Crippling Fear's Silence before that. If not, nothing is lost and you can skill Hunter In The Night.

                <br> Another thing is, don't just "support == CM and Venomancer" or "carry == Lifestealer and Luna". You need to be able to at least roughly guess the enemy's skill-build and (future) item build just by observing their actions.
                And that only works if you know every hero in every role well.<br><br>

                    <indent>
                        As a support your positioning will depend a lot on your Skills (Cooldowns).<br>
                        Consider if you getting in a few more right-clicks is worth the greater danger of getting killed, either by AoE or focus-fire. Would staying back and waiting for your Cooldowns get you more?<br>
                        Outside of (team-)fights, be aware of the enemy's range and any "modifiers" to that range - think slows, ranged stuns, gap-closers etc. Don't let a Venge get close to you, a (swap-)stun can suddenly leave you very vulnerable even if you had good positioning.<br>
                        Be a boss if you know that you have an advantage over the enemy. Don't just sit back, even if your team gets good farm. You can never win a lane hard enough.

                    <u>Solo Laner</u><br>
                    <indent>
                        "Be a boss" applies here as well. Take advantage of ranged over melee (especially if you have a good attack animation, like QoP) even if you can get nearly uncontested farm. Deny them, take the Creep-Aggro etc.<br>
                        Solos appear in all forms and shapes, sometimes your role might be to control the enemy (Puck), deal a lot of AoE damage (QoP), burst down a single hero (Clockwerk), deal a lot of sustained damage (Bristleback), etc...<br>
                        Again, be aware of that and play accordingly. It's OK to drop a 5-man Silence and Dream Coil as Puck and then die, you have done your job and your team should be able to clean up. As a Bristleback on the other side staying alive longer
                        and dealing sustained damage is your job. Weave in and out of the battle to build up your stacks of Quill Spray if you are low.

                    <u>Carry</u><br>
                    <indent>
                        If you can get a kill, go for it. Your farm is most likely more important than the enemies farm though, don't commit too much.<br>
                        Carries usually play a bigger role in team-fights and get focused more often. Be aware of that and use it to your advantage. Kite the enemy and make the time for your
                        team to get in another barrage of spells. When they stop following you, go and hit them. Blindly right-clicking the enemy because you are the carry will often just result in an early death, however you want to stay alive.
                        If the team-fight is not going as planned, retreat. You will loose the most by dying. A few deaths more is not as big of a problem for a support.
