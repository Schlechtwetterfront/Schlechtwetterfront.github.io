      CryENGINE 3 exporter for Softimage.  

      * Intuitive workflow for exporting.
      * No special setup required for a basic export.
      * CryEngine specific material properties directly interface with Softimage materials,
      so there is no restriction on the type of shaders/materials you can use in XSI.
      * Batch export.
      * Support for different grid-units (1 unit = 1cm or 1m).
      * Animation export + straight forward animation clip editor.

      Check the sidebar for a link to the releases page on GitHub.
          
      To install SoftCry, unzip the downloaded archive into
      `C:/users/%user%/Autodesk/Softimage_%version%/Addons/`
      OR
      `C:/users/%user%/Softimage/Softimage_%version%/Addons/`.
      Make sure you use this path and not the factory addon path.  

      If you have any Softimage version up to (and including) 2010 you need to install
      [python](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6.msi)
      and
      [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20217/pywin32-217.win32-py2.6.exe/download).
      If python and pywin32 was installed correctly it should look something like
      [this](installed_python.jpg).
