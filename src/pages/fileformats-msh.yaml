      This page lists all .MSH file chunks.
      In the .MSH file these chunks are organized in a hierarchy with [HEDR](#hedr){: .chunk}
      (header) being the first chunk and branching out from there
      (as visualized in the sidebar navigation).

      Some of these chunks are exclusive to certain versions of the engine
      (Star Wars: The Clone Wars and before, Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II)
      or deprecated completely. Most notably Cloth Simulation ([CLTH](#clth){: .chunk} and children)
      being limited to Star Wars: Battlefront II.
