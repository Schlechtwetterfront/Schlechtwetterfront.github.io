This is a collection of documentation on some of ZeroEngine's proprietary file formats. It contains documentation for the `.msh`, `.ter` and `.xxw` file formats, all used in ZeroEngine.

Most of the groundwork was laid by riley-man on Gametoast. I corrected and fleshed out a lof of his work and added some yet unresearched chunks (usually from later version of the engine coming with SWBFII).
