    Basically a glow map. Requires an additional texture. The texture's alpha channel determines glow strength, rgb glow color and intensity.
    May actually be [Detail](#detail).

    Specular power is affected by material color and Specular Decay (gloss).

    This uses the diffuse texture's alpha channel for specular intensity.
    Specular Color and Decay are used to determine specularity.
    Make sure the values are valid.
    If they are too low the specular might not appear.
    If the diffuse texture doesn't have an alpha channel specular will be turned off.

    Environment map. Gives the illusion of reflection on a surface.
    If no environment map is specified as Texture1 then the game will choose one
    dynamically at run time.
    If the object is static or does not move you should provide an environment map.

    Animates UVs to loop through different UV positions on the texture.
    UVs should be mapped to the first cell and not the whole texture.
    Cells have to be square and will be calculated automatically from the number of frames.  
    The number of cells always habe to be square (4, 9, 16, etc).

    Models bend the light (see Bothan Spy).
    Model behaves as a transparent object but the transparency is distorted.
    Alpha channel of the diffuse is used to control the opacity.
    Requires an additional bump texture which controls amount of distortion. 
    A refraction object can have an optional environment map associated with it.
